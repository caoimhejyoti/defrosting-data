## About

The project takes raw weather data and converts it into meaniful text-based summaries.

## Project Requirements

Starter code was provided with this project. Original starter code can be found here:
https://github.com/SheCodesAus/plus-weather-project-template

The requirment for this project was to make all the test files pass by creating functions based on docustring information, within the weather.py file.

The docustring information has been left in the code to provide clear information as to what each function is doing.
